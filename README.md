Password Checker is a program that guides you through a password creation process, and allows you to select the password requirements.

## Features

- Checking the strength of the selected password
- Estimating the number of tries necessary to guess it
- Automatically generate a compliant password


## Installation

Download the full repository and save it in a folder.

---

## Usage and configuration

To try the program, run password_creator.py

Currently, the only password requirement is to have at least 4 characters.
Changing the booleans in the CHECKS section of the config file will turn on checks for other conditions, such as presence of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits and special symbols.

Want to contribute? Great!

This program started as a project for my programming course, but I'd be happy to expand it.
